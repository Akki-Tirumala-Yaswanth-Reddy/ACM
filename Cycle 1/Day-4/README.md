# Day 4

- I first created Decision tree and Random forest classifier.
- Then i used the info from random forest to get the top 3 features.
- I used the top 3 features to create KNN.
- Decision tree and Random forest performed really well with 100% accuracy.
- KNN had an accuracy of 97% when used with n_neighbours = 2, and ~~ 97% when used with n_neighbours > 2
