# Day 4

- I first created Decision tree and Random forest classifier.
- Then i used the info from random forest to get the top 3 features.
- I used the top 3 features to create KNN.
- Decision tree and Random forest performed really well with 100% accuracy.
- When i reduced the train data size to 20% they gave an accuracy of 98%.
- KNN had an accuracy of 97% when used with n_neighbours = 2, and ~~ 96% when used with n_neighbours > 2.
- Overall, Random forests and descision tree worked really well, I think because there were many features and these models are the best when we have a lot of features.
