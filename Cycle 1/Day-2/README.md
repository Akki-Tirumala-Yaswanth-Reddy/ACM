# Day 2

- ** It took a lot of time to get the model to predict correctly. I still have some doubts regarding the feature selection, which I will try to learn.**

## Feature selection

- I seperated numerical, nominal and ordial values and processed them seperately.
- I used one hot encoder for nominal values and manual mapping for ordinal values.
- I used power transformer on numerical values.

## Models

- I ran the MSE and R2 scores for Linear regression, Lasso, and Ridge.
