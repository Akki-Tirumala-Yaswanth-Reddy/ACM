# Final project of cycle 2

- I choose XGBoost because it is the fastest among the other models, and it works better because of the large size of the data set.

- TD-IDF ranks the words based on their importance(i.e the amount of information the provide) and a value is given to each word, by using TD * IDF for each word in a sentence each sentence is turned into a vector. WHich will then be used for predictions.

- The biggest challenge was data cleaning, had to use a lot regex, had get external help.
